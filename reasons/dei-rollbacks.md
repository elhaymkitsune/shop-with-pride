# DEI Rollbacks
Around summer of 2024, many high-profile companies began rolling back their commitments to Diversity, Equality, and Inclusion (DEI) programs (sometimes seen as DEIA to include Accessibility). 

DEI is a corporate governance practice that has roots stretching back to the [Civil Rights Act of 1957](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Rights_Act_of_1957).
