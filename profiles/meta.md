# Meta
Following the inauguration in January 2025, Meta started becoming explicitly hostile to the LGBTQ+ community. Not only were they among the many companies that decided to [roll back their DEI policies](https://www.axios.com/2025/01/10/meta-dei-memo-employees-programs), they have also [updated their hateful conduct policy](https://www.reddit.com/r/MtF/comments/1hyrrb1/remember_meta_said_theyd_update_their_guidelines/) to explicitly exclude hate speech towards people based on their gender identity.

The [current hateful conduct policy](https://transparency.meta.com/en-us/policies/community-standards/hateful-conduct/) now includes the following:

> We do allow allegations of mental illness or abnormality when based on gender or sexual orientation, given political and religious discourse about transgenderism and homosexuality and common non-serious usage of words like “weird.”
