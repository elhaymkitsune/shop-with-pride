# Elon Musk
Elon Musk is an extremely problematic individual with a hate for transgender people that has leaked into everything he owns (see [Twitter LGBT toxicity](https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-news/year-elon-musk-bought-twitter-lgbtq-people-say-become-toxic-rcna122154), [SpaceX HQ threat](https://www.advocate.com/news/elon-musk-companies-california-texas)). He has been condemned by the [Human Rights Campaign](https://www.hrc.org/press-releases/human-rights-campaign-condemns-x-elon-musk-for-accepting-timeline-takeover-of-transphobic-fact-free-documentary) and [GLSN](https://www.glsen.org/news/glsen-condemns-elon-musks-transphobic-misinformation-campaign) for his anti-trans agenda.

In addition to his hate towards the LGBTQ+ community, his governmental efficiency organization DOGE has been [systematically dismantling governmental organizations](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/elon-musks-government-dismantling-fight-stop/story?id=118576033) that have been put in place to protect consumers from predatory corporate practices. Given his [strong associations to techno-libertarians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Views_of_Elon_Musk), he is almost certainly working towards the [Butterfly Revolution](https://www.reddit.com/r/Feminism/comments/1inemlj/whats_going_on_in_america_is_a_coup_heres/).
