This site is a collection of my research from trying to "vote with my wallet" by directing my time and money towards companies that support the LGBTQ+ community. This is obviously a very complicated issue with copious room for ambiguity.

It's also worth mentioning that many of these companies are problematic in other ways and this site primarily focuses on LGBTQ+ issues. I am still very much trying to figure out how to judge whether a company deserves my business so I will almost certainly get some of this stuff wrong and I welcome contributions to hone in on better answers.
